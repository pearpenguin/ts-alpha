## First time setup for local development
1. Ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed
2. Clone this repo locally
3. Create symbolic link to local docker-compose:

        ln -s docker-compose.local.yml docker-compose.override.yml
3. Build tsalpha image using the provided `dc` wrapper command (this will pass the current UID to avoid permission problems later)

        ./dc build
4. Create symbolic link to `.env.local` which contains default app settings

        ln -s .env.local .env
5. Install composer dependencies

        docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/app composer:2 composer install
6. Run the docker images, and wait for database to finish init

        ./dc up
7. Setup Laravel migration table

        ./dc exec tsalpha php artisan migrate:install
7. Run database migrations to setup database tables

        ./dc exec tsalpha php artisan migrate
8. Goto `localhost:8000` to test if the app is running

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
